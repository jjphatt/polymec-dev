* GNUPLOT


- Residual Histories

To generate example file 'residual_histories.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot1.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot1.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot1.bat

gnuplot1b.sh and gnuplot1b.bat are more sophisticated versions
for gnuplot 4.4 or later. 


- Matrix Pattern

To generate example file 'matrix_pattern.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run gnuplot2.sh as follows:

> ./gnuplot2.sh ../test/testmat.mtx

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot2.bat
and run as follows:

> gnuplot2.bat ..\test\testmat.mtx


- Eigenvalue Distribution

To generate example file 'eigenvalue_distribution.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot3.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot3.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot3.bat


- Eigenvectors

To generate example file 'eigenvectors.eps' on UNIX systems, 
run the following sample script:

> ./gnuplot4.sh

On Windows systems, edit the path to gnuplot.exe in gnuplot4.bat
and run the script as follows:

> gnuplot4.bat

gnuplot4.sh and gnuplot4.bat are for gnuplot 4.4 or later.
