// DistributedTessellator
// 
// Provides a parallel tessellation.

// This class assumes the user provides:
// 1.  A serial Tessellator.
// 2.  The generators in parallel, distributed in any manner the user likes
//     so long as the generators are not degenerate: i.e., don't repeast the
//     same generator on different domains.
//
// Based on the parallel tessellation algorithm originally implemented in 
// Spheral++.
