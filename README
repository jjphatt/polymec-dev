Polymec is a set of libraries that can be used to construct models for 
physical systems. Specifically, Polymec is designed with the goal of solving 
nonlinear partial differential equations on arbitrary polyhedral grids such 
as 3D Voronoi tessellations, or using mesh-free methods. The framework is 
designed to make for low-maintenance science applications with robust 
capabilities. Areas of emphasis are:

- High-quality, robust geometry generation and representation.
- Stiffly-accurate, A-stable implicit time integrators that use matrix-free 
  Jacobian formulations with high-quality preconditioners without a lot of 
  application-specific design.
- A strategy that favors a small code footprint and good scalability, likely 
  at the expense of implementations that run optimally on serial computers.

Polymec is licensed under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) v. 2.0, which is 
described/defined in the LICENSE file. This license requires you to make 
available any changes you have made to Polymec that are required for any 
software you distribute that uses it. It makes no other restrictions on your 
distribution of software involving Polymec.

The 3rd-party libraries used by Polymec have their own licenses which are 
described within the various source trees in the 3rdparty directory. Source 
files have been minimally modified within these trees; typically they contain 
files extracted directly from distribution tarballs. Instructions for 
obtaining the distributions are given within.
