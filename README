Polymec is a set of libraries that can be used to construct models for 
physical systems. Specifically, Polymec is designed with the goal of solving 
nonlinear partial differential equations on arbitrary polyhedral grids such 
as 3D Voronoi tessellations, or using mesh-free methods. The framework is 
designed to make for low-maintenance science applications with robust 
capabilities. Areas of emphasis are:

- High-quality, robust geometry generation and representation.
- Stiffly-accurate, A-stable implicit time integrators that use matrix-free 
  Jacobian formulations with high-quality preconditioners without a lot of 
  application-specific design.
- A strategy that favors a small code footprint and good scalability, likely 
  at the expense of implementations that run optimally on serial computers.
