Polymec is a set of libraries that can be used to construct models for 
physical systems. These libraries are designed to allow a computational 
scientist to construct low-maintenance science applications with robust 
capabilities. Areas of emphasis are:

- Solution of strongly nonlinear partial differential equations on domains 
  represented by unstructured (polyhedral) grids and/or mesh-free methods.
- Stiffly-accurate, A-stable implicit time integrators that use matrix-free 
  Jacobian formulations with high-quality preconditioners without a lot of 
  application-specific design.
- A strategy that favors a small code footprint and good scalability, likely 
  at the expense of implementations that run optimally on serial computers.

The 3rd-party libraries used by Polymec have their own licenses which are 
described within the various source trees in the 3rdparty directory. Source 
files have been minimally modified within these trees; typically they contain
