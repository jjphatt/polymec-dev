Polymec (pronounced "polimec") is a set of libraries that can be used to
construct models for linear and nonlinear physical systems. Specifically, 
Polymec is designed with the goal of solving nonlinear partial differential 
equations on arbitrary polyhedral grids such as 3D Voronoi tessellations.
My areas of research in the development so far are:

- High-quality, centroidal Voronoi grid generation
- More sophisticated forms of time integration
  - Stiffly-accurate fully-implicit integrators
  - Stiffly-accurate, A-stable semi-implicit integrators such as 
    Additive Runge-Kutta (ARK) methods
- Multi-species and multi-phase hydrodynamics with diffusion
