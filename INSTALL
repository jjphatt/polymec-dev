Software Requirements
---------------------

The polymec library requires the following software for installation:

  - A C compiler that adheres to (or aspires to) the C11 standard. 
    GCC 4.9+ and Clang 3.4+ work well.
  - A reasonable C++ compiler (for the C++ build/link test)
  - A Fortran compiler for LAPACK/BLAS and for special functions
  - A working set of LAPACK/BLAS libraries
  - CMake 3.10+ (found at http://www.cmake.org)
  - GNU Make
  - The Bourne Again SHell (bash)
  - A recent version of Git (if you're doing code development).

--------
Building 
--------

To build polymec on a UNIX-like system, change to the polymec-dev directory 
and type the following commands:

     $ ./bootstrap build_dir

where build_dir is the directory in which you want to build. Then just 
follow the onscreen directions: You change to that build directory, edit a 
config.sh file to define your build, and then start the build using your 
generator's build process. For the default generator (UNIX makefiles), this 
is just 'make'.

------------
Installation
------------

To install polymec, use the install command for the generator you've selected.
For example, if you're using a generator that writes UNIX makefiles, run

    $ make install [-j #threads]

from your build directory. 

------------------
Other make targets
------------------

   $ make test 
          Runs all unit tests for the library.

   $ make memcheck 
          Runs all unit tests for the library using a memory checking tool
          if you're on Linux and Valgrind is available.

   $ make clean 
          Removes all object files but retains the configuration options.

   $ make stats 
          Prints some interesting code statistics to the screen. 
          Requires Python.
   
   $ make coverage 
          Generates a code coverage report. This only works if you enable 
          the COVERAGE build option in config.sh, and if gcov and lcov 
          are available.
