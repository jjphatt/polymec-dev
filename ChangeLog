    * polymec: version 1.1
    * The implementation of the distance_based_neighbor_pairing_new function,
      bundled with the neighbor_pairing class, had a bug in its parallel 
      implementation, which has been fixed.
    * Added support for LIS Krylov solvers (no block matrix support yet).
    * Implemented parallel_sort.
    * Implemented dynamic repartitioning of point clouds.
    * Added interface support for variable-sized block krylov matrices.
    * Added logging mode for output to all ranks.
    * Various little enhancements for the build system.
    * Removed support for NERSC hopper.
    * Point cloud dynamic repartitioning now works.
    * Also, there's a new migrator type that is distinct from the exchanger 
      type, since having the latter do both exchanges and transfers was 
      confusing.
    * The Krylov matrix/vector classes no longer include assembly methods in their interfaces.
    * Numerous bugs were fixed in the HYPRE Krylov solver. The PCG, GMRES, and BICGSTAB solvers now correctly solve the 1D Laplace equation.
    *  LIS now builds with debugging symbols (and without optimization) under Debug builds.
    *  HYPRE error reporting is now improved.
    * All interfaces (LIS, PETSc, HYPRE) use 64-bit integers to store global indices.
    * Reworked the Krylov solver unit test to be thorough for PETSc/HYPRE 
      interfaces.
    * New methods have been added to the krylov_matrix class for adding and 
      inserting/getting blocks.
    * Variable and fixed block matrices are now supported in all Krylov 
      solver implementations.
    * Polymec's versioning information now doesn't include diffs in tests.
    * The build system is more selective about generating headers and version 
      information, resulting in considerable build savings when debugging 
      small numbers of files.
    * Travis CI now builds PETSc/HYPRE libraries where they are to be tested.
    * Bumped Lua to 5.3.3.
    * Bumped HDF5 to 1.10.0-patch1.
    * Added missing migrator methods, which allow us to use the migrator 
      interface and avoid the deprecated portion of the exchanger interface.
    * Simplified the logic behind the determination of HDF5 library names in 
      the 3rd-party build system in order for successful builds on NERSC 
      Edison/Cori.
    * The Lua interpreter's functions are now documented.
    * Enhanced logging features like log_mode(), more flexible ordering of log-related command line args.
    * Failed assertions now report MPI ranks.
    * Exchangers now support int64_t via MPI_INT64_T, and serialization/deserialization code has been tidied up.
    * Dynamic mesh partitioning works in all test cases. We'll see.
    * Also fixed a bug in the initial partitioning of rectilinear meshes.

    * polymec: version 1.0 (initial release)
    A set of high-performance software libraries that can be used to construct
    models for physical systems.
