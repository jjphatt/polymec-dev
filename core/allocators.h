///   a refcounted objbect (but that function doesn't do anything).
/// * Retaining a refcounted object increments that object's refcount. Do this
///   with \ref retain_ref when you want to keep an object alive to guarantee 
///   access to it.
/// * Releasing a refcounted object decrements that object's refcount. Do this
///   with \ref release_ref when you no longer need an object that you've
