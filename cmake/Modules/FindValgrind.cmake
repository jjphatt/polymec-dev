# Find Valgrind.
#
# This module defines:
#  VALGRIND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find valgrind/memcheck.h, etc.
#  VALGRIND_PROGRAM, the valgrind executable.
#  VALGRIND_FOUND, If false, do not try to use valgrind.
#
# If you have valgrind installed in a non-standard place, you can define
# VALGRIND_PREFIX to tell cmake where it is.
